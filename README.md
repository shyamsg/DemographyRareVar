Demography using rare variants across populations
-------------------------------------------------
Using the rare variants in the populations and studying the distribution of the
haplotype lengths around the rare variant itself along with other metrics such
as the frequency with which the core haplotype of the rare variant recombines out
to either its own or another population, we can estimate parameters such as the 
migration rate, populations sizes etc. The frequency of the rare variant gives us
lets us limit the age of the mutation. Aggregating across the different rare variants 
in the genome with the same frequency (or in the same bin), we can get better
estimates of the population parameters.
